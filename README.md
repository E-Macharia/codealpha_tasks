### 1. ðŸš— Car Price Prediction - Data Science Task

This is a **Data Science project** focused on predicting the prices of used cars based on key attributes such as year of manufacture, present price, fuel type, and seller type.

#### ðŸ“Š Project Overview
In this project, I performed:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training using regression techniques  
- Model evaluation and predictions

The goal is to assist buyers and sellers in estimating the fair value of a used car using machine learning models.

#### ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Car Price Prediction ML.ipynb` â€” Complete Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and model development.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Dataset
Key features in the dataset:
- **Car_Name**
- **Year**
- **Selling_Price**
- **Present_Price**
- **Kms_Driven**
- **Fuel_Type**
- **Seller_Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Owner**

The dataset was preprocessed, encoded, and used for model training and evaluation.

#### ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

- Sepal length and width
- Petal length and width

The steps included:
- Data visualization  
- Data preprocessing  
- Model building  
- Model evaluation

#### ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Iris Flower Classification.ipynb` â€” Complete Jupyter Notebook with the full workflow.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Dataset
The Iris dataset contains:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species**

#### ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

- Feature engineering  
- Regression model training  
- Model evaluation and future sales prediction

This project highlights the application of data science techniques to real-world business forecasting.

#### ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Sales Prediction using Python.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, modeling, and prediction sections.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Dataset
Features in the dataset include:
- **Product ID**
- **Product Category**
- **Sales Figures**
- **Other relevant attributes** depending on the dataset

#### ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- Python
