# 🚗Task 3  Car Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction ML** project! This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on several key features like year of manufacture, present price, fuel type, seller type, and more.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I built and evaluated a regression model capable of predicting used car prices. The goal is to help sellers and buyers estimate fair car values using machine learning.

The workflow includes:
- Data exploration and visualization  
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Final predictions  

## 📂 Files in this Repository

- `Car Price Prediction ML.ipynb` — The main Jupyter Notebook with the entire code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions (this file).

## 📈 Dataset

The dataset used contains the following columns:
- **Car_Name**
- **Year**
- **Selling_Price**
- **Present_Price**
- **Kms_Driven**
- **Fuel_Type**
- **Seller_Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Owner**

The data was preprocessed, encoded, and used to train regression models for price prediction.
